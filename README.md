# Moon Mod

Originally by sutr90 from the Minecraft Forum, this mod adds The Moon!

## Prerequisites
- BTA 7.1 pre2a
- [Halplibe](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/bta-halplibe) 3.5.1 or above
- [Dragonfly](https://github.com/UselessSolutions/DragonFly) 1.4.7-7.1 or above
- [TerrainAPI](https://github.com/UselessSolutions/TerrainAPI) 1.4.4-7.1 or above

## Instructions
To get to the Moon you must make a cheese portal using milk. (Four buckets is a block!)

Then you need to make a Sonic Screwdriver using redstone and iron.

Then once your portal is assembled, right click it with the screwdriver!

But remember - there's __NO AIR__ on the moon!

The spacesuit requires glass, iron, and reinforced cloth. Cloth is made with gold and wool.

Now you're set to explore the natural satellite of Minecraftia!
